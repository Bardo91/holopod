# Configuring you Raspberry Pi to use DLP2000EV

This document contains a brief guide about how to configure your Raspberry Pi to output the desktop through the Display Parallel Port to visualize it in the DLP device. This tutorial is also covered in my youtube channel (LINK). 

I have tested it in a RPi3, RPi4 and a RPiZero2.

## 1. Install raspbian

## 2. Configure the SD card to allow remote conection without screen

## 3. Setup the boot configuration to enable DPP

## 4. Play a bit with the I2C code and the user manual
